# Purpose and Scope

The purpose of making this tic tac toe game was to generally practice writing code, more specifically get more practice with javascript DOM manipulation.

# Game

The game is tic tac toe with basic UI which renders the board, the player inputs and declares a winner, and declares a draw otherwise.

## Cool takeaways

- Javascript array methods
- Programming is really just problem solving, and I should think of it that way as as opposed to 'I need to code a solution' I should think 'I need to understand the problem, and propose a solution' before I even really start typing. Once i really understand the problem and proposed a solution, the code flows out and figuring out how to do something I currently don't know how to do syntactically is just a matter of googling
-  I really realised this when thinking about how I want to check for a winner;
  - How can I get the computer to understand what 'winning' involves? -> it would need to 'see' that either player has won, easy enough for us visually without performing any computations (has any player made 3 entries in a line?), but the program must understand -> we can do this by defining possible 'winning' combinations etc
